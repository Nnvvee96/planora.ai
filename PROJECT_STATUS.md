## üìã Feature Requirements Analysis

Here is a point-by-point analysis of each requirement, its current implementation state, and the identified gaps.

### 1. Authentication & Registration

| Status | Feature | Requirement | Current State & Analysis | Gap / Missing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚úÖ **Done** | **Google Sign-In** | User signs in, email is auto-verified, proceeds to onboarding, data is stored. | The flow is implemented. `googleAuthHelper.ts` and `supabaseAuthService.ts` handle the OAuth callback and profile creation. The user is correctly redirected to the `/onboarding` route. | None. This appears to be working as intended. |
| üü° **Partially Done** | **Email/Password Registration** | Form with Country/City, summary page, verification code, account created **only after** verification. | We have a two-phase registration (`initiateSignup`, `completeSignup`) using a verification code, which is correct. The `Register.tsx` page exists. | **1. UI:** The registration form in `Register.tsx` is basic and **lacks the dynamic Country/City fields**. **2. Summary Page:** There is **no summary page** shown after initial form submission. **3. Account Creation Timing:** This is the most critical gap. The `initiate-signup` function likely creates an entry in `auth.users` immediately. Your requirement is that the user is not created until the code is verified. We need to confirm and likely change this. **The user should not exist in the system at all until verification is complete.** |

### 2. Onboarding Logic

| Status | Feature | Requirement | Current State & Analysis | Gap / Missing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚ùå **Missing** | **Conditional Location Logic** | Different logic for handling departure location based on whether the user registered via form or Google. | This logic is entirely missing. The `Onboarding.tsx` component and related services (`userProfileService.ts`, `travelPreferencesService.ts`) do not contain any conditional logic to distinguish between a Google-authenticated user and a form-registered user for pre-filling or linking locations. | We need to implement the full conditional workflow: <br> ‚Ä¢ **Detect auth method.** <br> ‚Ä¢ **Onboarding:** Pre-fill location for form users; require manual entry for Google users. <br> ‚Ä¢ **Profile Updates:** Create the specific linking behavior where `user_location` updates `departure_location` but not necessarily the other way around. |

### 3. Email, Password, & Account Logic

| Status | Feature | Requirement | Current State & Analysis | Gap / Missing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üü° **Partially Done** | **Change Email** | Requires a secure confirmation link to be clicked before the change is finalized. | The `updateEmail` function exists in `supabaseAuthService.ts`, but it's a direct update. It **does not implement the required two-step "secure link" confirmation process**. | The entire secure flow needs to be built: <br> 1. User requests change in UI. <br> 2. Backend sends a verification email to the *new* address. <br> 3. User clicks the link. <br> 4. A handler verifies the token and finalizes the email change in the database. |
| üü° **Partially Done** | **Reset/Change Password** | Reset requires a link. Change requires the current password and a confirmation link. | `sendPasswordResetEmail` and `resetPassword` functions exist and likely follow Supabase's standard (and secure) flow. However, the "Change Password" flow is **missing the email confirmation link step**. | We need to add the email confirmation step to the "Change Password" flow for enhanced security. |
| ‚ùå **Missing** | **Delete Account** | `DELETE` keyword modal -> secure email link -> soft delete -> 30-day reactivation link. | The `deleteUserProfile` function in `userProfileService.ts` performs a hard delete via Supabase. **None of the required safety features (modal, email link, soft delete, reactivation) are implemented.** | This is a significant feature to build: <br> 1. UI modal with keyword confirmation. <br> 2. Backend logic to trigger a confirmation email. <br> 3. A handler for the email link that performs a "soft delete" (e.g., sets `account_status` to `pending_deletion` and sets a `deleted_at` timestamp). <br> 4. A separate mechanism/endpoint for reactivation. <br> 5. A scheduled task (e.g., a cron job) to perform the hard delete after 30 days. |
| ‚ùå **Missing** | **Google User Email Change** | Must set a password first, which unlinks Google Auth and converts the account to email/password. | This entire workflow is missing. There is no logic to detect this specific scenario or guide the user through creating a password and unlinking their Google account. | A new UI flow and backend logic are needed to handle this conversion process gracefully and securely. |

### 4. Roles & Access Levels

| Status | Feature | Requirement | Current State & Analysis | Gap / Missing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üü° **Partially Done** | **Role Management** | Admin & Tester roles. Admin can bypass auth. | We have an `is_beta_tester` boolean flag in the `profiles` table and a basic `/admin` page. This serves the "Tester" role. The concept of an "Admin" role exists but is not fully fleshed out. | **1. Admin Privileges:** The critical "bypass authentication" capability for Admins is **missing** and would require significant work with Supabase RLS and custom logic. **2. Role System:** We are using a simple boolean flag. A more robust solution would be a dedicated `roles` table or an enum field in the `profiles` table to support future roles. |

### 5. Subscription Model

| Status | Feature | Requirement | Current State & Analysis | Gap / Missing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ‚ùå **Not Started** | **Subscription Tiers** | Free, Middle, Premium tiers managed via Stripe. | We have a placeholder `subscriptionService.ts`. You've mentioned the API keys are available. However, **no actual implementation exists**. | This is a major epic. We need to: <br> 1. Design the database schema for subscriptions. <br> 2. Implement Stripe Checkout for plan upgrades. <br> 3. Create a Stripe webhook handler to listen for successful payments and update the user's tier in our database. <br> 4. Implement logic throughout the app to check the user's subscription tier and unlock/restrict features accordingly. |

### 6. Future Features

| Status | Feature | Requirement | Current State & Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üöÄ **Future Task** | **Nearby Airports** | Extend onboarding to suggest nearby airports based on user's location. | As you stated, this is a future task. It is not part of the current implementation phase. |
