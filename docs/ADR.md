# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document records the key architectural decisions made for the Planora.ai project. Each decision is recorded to provide context for future development and ensure consistency in our approach.

## ADR-001: Feature-First with Atomic Design

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: We needed a clear architecture that would support scaling the application while keeping features isolated and UI components well-organized.

**Decision**: We've adopted a hybrid architecture that combines:
1. Feature-First organization for business logic and domain concerns
2. Atomic Design for UI components

**Consequences**:
- Features are encapsulated and have clear boundaries
- UI components are organized by complexity and reusability
- Cross-feature communication is formalized through integration hooks
- Maintenance and scalability are improved

## ADR-002: Feature Isolation and Integration Pattern

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Features need to communicate with each other without creating tight coupling.

**Decision**: We've implemented:
1. Each feature exposes a public API through an `api.ts` file
2. Integration hooks in `src/hooks/integration` facilitate cross-feature communication
3. The Redux store provides a centralized state for application-wide data

**Consequences**:
- Features are decoupled from each other
- Changes to a feature's implementation don't affect other features
- Testing is simplified with clear boundaries
- Feature teams can work independently

## ADR-003: No Index Files

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Index files (index.ts) often hide implementation details and make imports less explicit.

**Decision**: We've prohibited the use of index.ts files across the codebase.

**Consequences**:
- Import paths explicitly show what is being imported
- Refactoring is easier with clear file dependencies
- Debugging is improved with specific file references
- Code is more self-documenting

## ADR-004: Automated Architecture Validation

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Maintaining architectural consistency required automated enforcement.

**Decision**: We've implemented:
1. Custom dependency-cruiser rules to validate boundaries
2. ESLint plugins to enforce import patterns
3. Git hooks to prevent violations from being committed
4. Code generators (plop.js) to scaffold components following our patterns

**Consequences**:
- Architectural violations are caught early
- Consistency is maintained across the codebase
- Developers have clear guidance on proper patterns
- Technical debt is reduced

## ADR-005: UI Preservation During Restructuring

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: The architectural refactoring needed to maintain exact UI functionality.

**Decision**: We've maintained strict UI preservation by:
1. Keeping component implementations identical
2. Moving components to their architectural locations without changing behavior
3. Extensive testing to ensure visual consistency

**Consequences**:
- Users experience no disruption
- UI bugs are not introduced during restructuring
- Visual regression testing is simplified
